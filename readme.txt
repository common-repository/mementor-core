== Description ==

Mementor Core is a plugin initially built for Mementor's clients, but also for everyone which might find this plugin useful. Instead of writing the same code over and over again for each of our projects, we have moved some of the basic functionality to this plugin. That way all our projects can stay up to date, and we save a lot of time whenever we start a new project, or update the code on any of our existing projects.

Functionality added to this plugin will either be useful to our clients, or help us maintain the websites better. We have for example disabled the notification emails, which can be quite annoying when you run more than a hundred websites, and when you have other tools keeping track of plugin updates.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin conflict with my theme or any of my plugins? =

It shouldn't. We will test the plugin carefully, and add only code which will work on all of our projects. We have more than a hundred websites with different themes and plugins set up, and will make sure it works on all of them.
